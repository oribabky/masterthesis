\chapter{Literature Review}
%Write about the theory used in the research.
\emph{The chapter gives both general and specific information on theory used for this project.  Mathematical statistics, regression and machine learning are covered in the first three sections, providing a general understanding of the field of study. Specific machine learning models are explained in the final three sections of the chapter. }


\section{Machine learning}
	Programming is typically about writing explicit sequences of machine instructions for some software application. Once the application is used, it will decide logically what instructions to send to the machine depending on what input is given from the user, its current state etc. But as software becomes complex the %HERE%
	Machine learning is formally defined by Mitchell \cite{BOOK:2}: 
	A computer program is said to learn from experience $E$ with respect to some class of tasks $T$ and performance measure $P$ if its performance at tasks in $T$, as measured by $P$, improves with experience $E$.
	What this means is that machine learning algorithms is a way of 
	
	Two of the most common machine learning tasks: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{Classification:} The computer is asked to specify which category a certain input belongs to. An example of a classification task is
