\chapter{Literature Review}
%Write about the theory used in the research.
\emph{The chapter gives both general and specific information on theory used for this project.  Mathematical statistics, regression and machine learning are covered in the first three sections, providing a general understanding of the field of study. Specific machine learning models are explained in the final three sections of the chapter. }

\subsection{Machine learning}
	
	Two of the most common machine learning tasks: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{Classification:} The computer is asked to specify which category a certain input belongs to. An example of a classification task is  
		\item{Regression:} asdfsdf
	\end{itemize} \cite{BOOK:1}
