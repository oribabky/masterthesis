\chapter{Introduction}
\emph{The chapter starts with a background describing who Trafikverket are, why road condition monitoring is important to them, how road condition data is collected today and why the technology behind it needs improvement. An objective for the project is defined followed by its delimitations. Lastly, a thesis structure is presented to simplify navigation through different parts of the project.}

\section{Background}
%\begin{itemize}
	%Why improve road condition monitoring?
	%what is Trafikverket and what do they do? 
	%weatherstations, what are they? What's the road surface temperature sensor?
	%why is it desirable to simulate the road sensor?
	%what is machine learning? \cite{WEBSITE:1}

%\end{itemize}

\section{Objective}
	The objective is to determine if a road surface temperature sensor can be simulated with prediction models based on historic data from road weather information systems.
