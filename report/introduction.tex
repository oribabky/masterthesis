\section{Background}
%\begin{itemize}
	%Why improve road condition monitoring?
	%what is Trafikverket and what do they do? 
	%weatherstations, what are they? What's the road surface temperature sensor?
	%why is it desirable to simulate the road sensor?
	%what is machine learning? \cite{WEBSITE:1}
	Two of the most common machine learning tasks: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{Classification:} The computer is asked to specify which category a certain input belongs to.
		\item{Regression:} asdfsdf
	\end{itemize} \cite{BOOK:1}
	%why should machine learning be used for this purpose? \cite{BOOK:1}
	%how do we apply machine learning to solve the issue?

\section{Objective}
	The objective is to determine if a road surface temperature sensor can be simulated with prediction models based on data from road weather information systems.
