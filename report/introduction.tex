\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Background}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Why improve road condition monitoring?
	\item what is Trafikverket and what do they do? 
	\item weatherstations, what are they? What's the road surface temperature sensor?
	\item why is it desirable to simulate the road sensor?
	\item what is machine learning?
	\item why should machine learning be used for this purpose?
\end{itemize}

\section{Objective}
	The objective is to determine if a road surface temperature sensor can be simulated with prediction models based on data from road weather information systems.
